## Configuration options

When you create the `ReceiptPrinterEncoder` object you can specify a number of options to help with the library with generating receipts. 

<br>

### Printer model

The easiest way to configure this library is by specifying the model of the printer that you are using. It will then automatically configure the most important configuration options, such as the printer language, supported code pages, image mode and more.

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({ 
    printerModel: 'epson-tm-t88vi'
});
```

To get a complete list of supported printers, you can look at the `printerModels` static property:

```js
console.log(ReceiptPrinterEncoder.printerModels);

[
    { id: "bixolon-srp350":     name: "Bixolon SRP-350" },
    { id: "bixolon-srp350iii":  name: "Bixolon SRP-350III" },
    { id: "citizen-ct-s310ii":  name: "Citizen CT-S310II" },
    { id: "epson-tm-p20ii":     name: "Epson TM-P20II" },
    { id: "epson-tm-t20iii":    name: "Epson TM-T20III" },
    ...
]
```

Our database of devices has some of the most used devices. However if you device is not supported, you may be able to try a similar printer model. 

For example, if if your printer is a newer or older version of a model that is supported, you can try the closest version that is in our database.

Or if you are using a cheap printer without a proper brandname, you can try `pos-5890` or `pos-8360`. Many cheap printers that you can find on AliExpress or TEMU use the same internals or firmware. 

<br>

-----

<br>

If your printer is not in the list, you can manually configure the settings for your printer with the options below. You can also use this to overwrite the default settings of the printer, for example if you want to use a Star printer in ESC/POS mode, or if you put 57 mm paper in a 80 mm printer.

<br>

### Printer language

It is possible to specify the language of the printer you want to use by providing a options object with the property `language` set to either `esc-pos`, `star-prnt` or `star-line`. By default the library uses ESC/POS.

To use the ESC/POS language use:

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({ 
    language: 'esc-pos'
});
```

Or for StarPRNT use:

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({ 
    language: 'star-prnt'
});
```

Or for StarLine use:

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({ 
    language: 'star-line'
});
```

<br>

### Paper width

To set the width of the paper you can use the `columns` property. Specify the number of characters that one line can hold. This will ensure that words will properly wrap to the next line at the end of the paper. 

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({
    columns: 48
});
```

The number of characters are measured using Font A which is 12 pixels wide. If you choose a smaller font the point where words will be wrapped will be automatically adjusted to take the new font width into account.

If you use 57mm wide paper, it allows you to print up to 32 or 35 characters horizontally, depending on the resolution of the printer.

If you use 80mm wide paper, it allows you to print up to 42, 44 or 48 characters horizontally, depending on the resolution of the printer.

<br>

### Feed before cut

In most printers the cutter is located above the printing mechanism, that means that if you cut immediately after printing a line of text, the cut will be above the text. 

To prevent this, you can feed the paper a number of lines before cutting the paper.

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({
    feedBeforeCut: 4
});
```

<br>

### Newline

Most printers use a combination of a newline and carriage return to move the text position to the beginning of the next line. 

However, some more exotic printers only use a newline, causing the printer to insert an extra empty line between each line of text.

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({
    newline: '\n'
});
```

<br>

### Image mode

If you use the ESC/POS language, depending on how new your printer is you might want to use `column` mode or `raster` image encoding mode. The default is `column`. 

The main difference is how images are encoded. Some newer printers do not support `raster` mode images, while some older printer do not support `column` mode images. It may depend on the printer model what mode you should use.

To opt in to `raster` mode you need to provide the constructor of the `ReceiptPrinterEncoder` class with an options object with the property `imageMode` set to `raster`.

```js
let encoder = new ReceiptPrinterEncoder({ 
    imageMode: 'raster' 
});
```
